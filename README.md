## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to extract meaningful business insights from Walmart's transactional data using Python for preprocessing and PostgreSQL for querying.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and database connection
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **SQLAlchemy**: Connecting Python to PostgreSQL
- **PostgreSQL**: Storing and querying the cleaned dataset
- **SQL**: Performing advanced queries for insights
- **Kaggle**: Data source
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data exploration and transformation


---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Performed using Python:
- Removed duplicates and null values
- Standardized column names and formats
- Converted data types appropriately (e.g., date and time columns)
- Handled inconsistent or incorrect entries
- Added derived columns like year, month, day, and hour for better analysis

---

## ðŸ—„ Database Integration

- Created a PostgreSQL database named `walmart_db`
- Loaded the cleaned dataset into a table using **SQLAlchemy** and **Pandas**

## ðŸ“Œ SQL Analysis & Insights

Here are the major insights generated using SQL:

1. **Payment Method Analysis**  
   Find the number of transactions and total quantity sold per payment method.

2. **Highest Rated Category per Branch**  
   Identify which category had the highest average rating in each store.

3. **Busiest Day per Branch**  
   Analyze which day of the week each branch had the most transactions.

4. **Product Rating Summary by City**  
   Evaluate average, minimum, and maximum product ratings city-wise.

5. **Category-Wise Profit Calculation**  
   Estimate total profit by category using formula: `unit_price * quantity * profit_margin`.

6. **Most Preferred Payment Method per Branch**  
   Determine which payment method was most frequently used per branch.

7. **Sales Time Slot Categorization**  
   Categorize invoices into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening slots.

8. **Revenue Drop Analysis**  
   Compare 2022 vs 2023 revenues to identify top 5 branches with the highest revenue drop ratio.
